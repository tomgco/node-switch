# Node Switch
`ns(1)`
Saves the time having to search for the required node binary for a specific project. Handy if you have personal projects using an unstable node branch and production code using stable.
----

## Installation
    $ npm install -g ns
or
    $ make install

## Defining Node Binary Management
This will default to TJ's `n`, this is required to switch to the correct node version when running.
